I am a physics graduate student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu). My
thesis advisor is [Prof. Alexander F. Kemper (Lex)](https://physics.ncsu.edu). I consider myself first and foremost a
scientist whose objects of interest happen to be condensed matter.

Prior to that, I earned my masters *BS-MS dual degree* from [Indian Institute
of Science Education and Research](www.iisermohali.ac.in) (IISER Mohali Punjab, India).

I joined NCSU in fall 2014 and started working on my research in lex's group since April 2016.

Currently, I am looking at the dynamics of Cooper pairs in 2D
superconductors when an ultra-fast laser pulse drives the system out of an
equilibrium state. I use Non-equilibrium Green Functions approach with Many
Body Perturbation Series to simulate the dynamics of Cooper pairs.
