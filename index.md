My current research interest is in understanding what role environment plays in the formation and evolution of galaxies. I use both
observations and simulations for this purpose. I don't like to classify myself as an observer or
a theorist. I believe that physical insights can only be achieved by combining predictions of theoretical models orsimulations with observations.
