I am a physics graduate student at [North Carolina State
University](https://www.ncsu.edu) (NCSU). My PhD thesis advisor is [Prof. Alexander F.
Kemper (Lex)](https://physics.ncsu.edu). I joined NCSU in fall 2014 and
started working on my thesis in Lex's group in April 2016. Prior to
that, I earned my masters *BS-MS dual degree* from [Indian Institute of
Science Education and Research](www.iisermohali.ac.in) (IISER Mohali Punjab,
India). I produced my masters thesis on *Complex Dynamical  Networks* under supervision of [Prof. Sudeshna Sinha](http://14.139.227.202/Faculty/sudeshna/).

My research focuses on the dynamics of quasi-particles in correlated condensed
matter systems. Mainly, I try to look at the system from a non-equilibrium perspective where we perturb a correlated electron system by a time-dependent
interaction and study the properties of the developed non-equilibrium state
in the time domain. I mainly use diagrammatic perturbation theory on the
Keldysh contour to solve the relevant equations of motion for one and two
particle propagators. I have also used tools of density functional theory,
dynamical mean field theory, and semi-analytical methods to study the electronic, transport and optical properties of a variety
of systems ranging from superconductors, Mott insulators and other phases of metals.
