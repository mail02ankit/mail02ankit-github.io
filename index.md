Welcome!!!

My name is Ankit Kumar. I am a researcher. I mainly spend my time on solving physics problems related to non-equilibrium
phenomena. However, recently I developed a great interest in Machine learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI).
Now, I am keen to use my physics knowledge to understand complex problems using data science tools.

On this blog (website), you may find a flavor of my research, projects, and a collection of data science problems I have
been working on.

I had a stint as a post-doctoral fellow at [the University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au) (UNSW). Before that, I did
my Ph.D. thesis with [Prof. Alexander F. Kemper (Lex)](https://www.physics.ncsu.edu/kemperlab/ ) at [North Carolina
State University](https://physics.ncsu.edu) in condensed matter physics.

You may find my Academic CV [here]( ../docs/CV_Academics.pdf) and Industrial Resume [here](../docs/CV_Indus.pdf).
