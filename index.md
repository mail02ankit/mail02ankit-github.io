I am a post-doctoral researcher in the group of [Prof. Dimitrie Culcer (Dimi)](https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/dimi-culcer) at [the University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au) (UNSW). I did my Ph.D. thesis with [Prof. Alexander F. Kemper (Lex)](https://www.physics.ncsu.edu/kemperlab/ ) at [North Carolina State University](https://physics.ncsu.edu) in condensed matter physics.

My research focuses on the dynamics of quasi-particles in correlated condensed matter systems. Mainly, I try to analyze
the system from a non-equilibrium perspective where we perturb a correlated electron system by a time-dependent
interaction and study properties of the developed non-equilibrium state in the time domain. I use density
matrix theory and diagrammatic perturbation theory on the Keldysh contour to solve the relevant equations of motion for
one and two-particle Green's functions. I also use tools of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory, and
semi-analytical methods to study the electronic, transport, and optical properties of a variety of systems ranging from
superconductors, Mott insulators, topological insulators, and other phases of metals.
