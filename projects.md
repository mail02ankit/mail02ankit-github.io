## High $T_c$ superconductor
 **P01** Understanding the mechanism behind high temperature superconductivity has been one of the challenges in condensed
 matter physics. The particular momentum structure of the electron-boson coupling plays a crucial role in the formation
 of Cooper pairs, which can lead to the enhanced superconductivity. One such example is electron-phonon interaction that                                                     
 is peaked in the forward direction. This interaction has been suggested as an essential ingredient for enhanced
 superconductivity observed in FeSe monolayers on STO substrates. We study the superconducting state of a system
 dominated by forward scattering using non-equilibrium methods and contrast its behavior against the standard isotropic
 BCS case. Our study shows that the superconducting order in the forward-focused case is robust and persistent against
 the pump-induced perturbations. The superconducting order parameter also exhibits a non-uniform melting in momentum
 space, which could be measured by time-resolved ARPES. We show that this behavior is in sharp contrast to the isotropic
 interaction case and propose that time-resolved approaches are a potentially powerful tool to differentiate the nature
 of the dominant coupling in correlated materials.

## Higgs mode in superconductors
Within the context of superconductivity, the excitations of superconducting condensate are of great interest.
Experimentally, it is difficult to excite a superconducting order because the order parameter is a scalar field
(spinless and chargeless), and does not couple to a vector electromagnetic (EM) field in the linear regime.
Because a superconducting state exhibits broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, when the order is perturbed, $U(1)$
symmetry breaks spontaneously and results in two oscillating bosonic modes: first, the massless phase mode through
Goldstone-Nambu mechanism and second, the massive amplitude mode through Higgs-Anderson mechanism. The phase mode gets
pushed to the plasma frequency range because of coupling to Coulomb interactions. The other excitation, the Higgs mode
resides at a frequency of twice the superconducting gap ($2\Delta$). Recently, it has been shown that the amplitude
mode can be excited, and observed thorough the time-resolved optical conductivity when the system is driven out of equilibrium 
by an intense, ultra-fast EM field.

### time-resolved optical conductivity
**P02** We studied the dynamics of Cooper pairs in a s-wave superconductor when an ultra-fast laser pulse drives the system out of an equilibrium state. Through functional derivation, the optical conductivity is obtained with full
vertex corrections and used to characterize the transient superconducting
state. The transient optical conductivity shows the suppression of the
superconducting order parameter in the time domain. The subsequent recovery
of the order parameter exhibits oscillatory behavior that corresponds to the
Higgs amplitude mode, and may be seen in several parts of the spectrum.

### With moving condensate
**P03** In addition to the higher order coupling of the Higgs mode to EM field, presence of a small supercurrent in the sample can also facilitate coupling of the Higgs 
mode to EM field in the linear-regime. Motivated by the recent theory and experimental work, we studied dynamics of the superconductivity condensate in the presence 
of a small supercurrent. We found that the condensate momentum induces a asymmetry of the spectral gap on the Fermi level which leads to momentum-dependent 
oscillation frequency and phase of the Higgs mode.
