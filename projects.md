## Forward scattering high $T_c$ superconductor


## Higgs mode in linear-regime
Within the context of superconductivity, the excitations of superconducting condensate are of great interest.
Experimentally, it is difficult to excite a superconducting order because the order parameter is a scalar field
(spinless and chargeless), and does not couple to a vector electromagnetic (EM) field in the linear regime.
Because a superconducting state exhibits broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, when the order is perturbed, $U(1)$
symmetry breaks spontaneously and results in two oscillating bosonic modes: first, the massless phase mode through
Goldstone-Nambu mechanism and second, the massive amplitude mode through Higgs-Anderson mechanism. The phase mode gets
pushed to the plasma frequency range because of coupling to Coulomb interactions. The other excitation, the Higgs mode
resides at a frequency of twice the superconducting gap ($2\Delta$). Recently, it has been shown that the amplitude
mode can be excited, and observed thorough the time-resolved optical conductivity when the system is driven out of equilibrium 
by an intense, ultra-fast EM field.

### time-resolved optical conductivity
We studied the dynamics of Cooper pairs in a s-wave superconductor when an ultra-fast laser pulse drives the system out of an equilibrium state. Through functional derivation, the optical conductivity is obtained with full
vertex corrections and used to characterize the transient superconducting
state. The transient optical conductivity shows the suppression of the
superconducting order parameter in the time domain. The subsequent recovery
of the order parameter exhibits oscillatory behavior that corresponds to the
Higgs amplitude mode, and may be seen in several parts of the spectrum.
