I am a physics graduate student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu). My
thesis advisor is [Prof. Alexander F. Kemper (Lex)](https://physics.ncsu.edu). I consider myself first and foremost a
scientist whose objects of interest happen to be astronomical objects.
Astronomical objects fascinate me because to understand them all disciplines
of physics from microscale quantum phenomena to macroscale gravity have to
come together. Also, who has not wondered about the twinkling shinny, bright
lights in the night sky as a kid.

Ankit Kumar completed his masters [BS-MS dual degree] from Indian Institute
of Science Education and Research (IISER Mohali Punjab, India). He joined NC
State in 2014 and started working in the group in 2016. Currently, he is
looking at the dynamics of Cooper pairs in 2D superconductors when an
ultra-fast laser pulse drives the system out of an equilibrium state. He uses
Non-equilibrium Green Functions approach with Many Body Perturbation Series
to simulate the dynamics of Cooper pairs.
