I am an astronomy graduate student at Australian National University. My
thesis advisor is Prof. Lisa Kewley. I consider myself first and foremost a
scientist whose objects of interest happen to be astronomical objects.
Astronomical objects fascinate me because to understand them all disciplines
of physics from microscale quantum phenomena to macroscale gravity have to
come together. Also, who has not wondered about the twinkling shinny, bright
lights in the night sky as a kid.
